// 1- Using recursion Write a JavaScript program to find the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two positive numbers.
// 2-Write a function called sum that accepts two numbers as parameters, and sum them together but without suming them togther directly
//you can only add one at each summetion, you'll need to use recursion in this.
